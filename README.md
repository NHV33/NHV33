### Who am I?

My name is Noel <sup>(rhymes with "soul")</sup>. I'm a full-stack software developer, educator, and researcher of applied linguistics. I began teaching myself to code in 2018 in order to develop software for my master's thesis, and it has since grown into my passion. I currently live in Kyoto Japan, where I am a part-time lecturer and PhD candidate at Kyoto University.
